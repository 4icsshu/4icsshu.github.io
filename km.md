Review of Knowledge and Knowledge Management Research


2. Knowledge
2.1. The Definition of Knowledge
Knowledge is a concept with rich connotations and extensive extension. There
are different opinions about the definition of knowledge in the academic world.
Scholars define knowledge from different perspectives. From the perspective of
epistemology, knowledge is consciousness, which defines knowledge equal to
consciousness . Knowledge is the result of experience, and knowledge is regarded
as the sum of human cognitive experience .
Knowledge is the sum of ideas, and it is the sum of people’s concepts of nature, society, and thinking phenomena and essence . From the perspective of ontology, knowledge is a special resource produced by the interaction between living matter and non-living matter. Knowledge is a civilizational resource caused by the evolution of nature to a certain stage . From the perspective of economics, knowledge is the product of human labor, and it is a human labor product with value and use value. From the perspective of information theory, knowledge is the accumulation of similar
information, and it is the abstraction and generalization of information to help
to achieve a specific purpose.

The various viewpoints listed above reflect the understanding of knowledge
from different perspectives, which lead to different understandings of knowledge
management. If knowledge is regarded as an object, or equal to information acquisition, then knowledge management should focus on establishing and managing knowledge reserves; if knowledge is a process, then knowledge management should focus on the process of knowledge flow and knowledge creation, sharing and distribution. Knowledge as a capability perspective believes that knowledge management focuses on building core competitiveness, understanding strategic advantages, and creating intellectual capital.
